## 1. Paraphrase the video in a few lines. Use your own word

A summary of the :
Angela Lee Duckworth's TED Talk "Grit: the power of passion and perseverance" explores the importance of grit, or the combination of passion and perseverance, in achieving success. Duckworth argues that grit is more important than IQ, and that grittier individuals are more likely to achieve their goals, even in the face of setbacks.

Duckworth defines grit as "the passion and perseverance for long-term goals." She identifies three components of grit: interest, perseverance, and resilience. Interest is a strong interest in a particular goal or activity. Perseverance is the ability to keep working towards a goal even when faced with challenges. Resilience is the ability to bounce back from setbacks.

Duckworth argues that grit can be learned and developed. She provides some tips for how to do so, including:

* Set challenging goals.
* Break down large goals into smaller steps.
* Find a support system.
* Don't give up.

Duckworth's TED Talk is a fascinating and inspiring exploration of the importance of grit. She provides a compelling argument that grit is a key ingredient for success, and she offers some practical tips for how to develop grit. If you're looking for ways to improve your chances of success, I highly recommend watching this talk.

Here are some additional points that Duckworth makes in the talk:

* Grit is not the same as talent. Talent is a starting point, but it's not enough to guarantee success.
* Grit is not about being immune to setbacks. Everyone experiences setbacks, but grittier individuals are better able to bounce back from them.
* Grit is not about being fearless. Gritty individuals are afraid of failure, but they don't let fear stop them from pursuing their goals.

## 2. What are your key takeaways from the video to take action on?

Here are my key takeaways from the video "Grit: the power of passion and perseverance" to take action on:

* **Set challenging goals.** Goals that are too easy will not challenge you and will not help you to develop grit. However, goals that are too difficult will discourage you and may lead you to give up. It is important to find a balance and set goals that are challenging but achievable.
* **Break down large goals into smaller steps.** This will make the goals seem less daunting and more manageable. It will also help you to track your progress and stay motivated.
* **Find a support system.** Having people who believe in you and support your goals can make a big difference. They can offer encouragement, advice, and help you to stay on track.
* **Don't give up.** When you face setbacks, don't give up. Learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward. Remember that everyone experiences setbacks, but grittier individuals are better able to bounce back from them.
* **Identify your passions.** What are you passionate about? What do you love to do? Once you know what you're passionate about, you can start to set goals related to those passions.
* **Be persistent.** Don't give up on your goals, even when they get tough. Keep working towards them, even when you don't feel like it.
* **Be resilient.** Learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward. Don't let setbacks discourage you.
* **Be optimistic.** Believe in yourself and your ability to achieve your goals. Stay positive, even when things get tough.

## 3. Paraphrase the video in a few lines in your own words.

 The is a paraphrase of the video "Growth Mindset Introduction" in my own words:

Carol Dweck, a psychologist, discusses the two types of mindsets: fixed mindset and growth mindset. People with a fixed mindset believe that their intelligence and abilities are fixed, while people with a growth mindset believe that their intelligence and abilities can grow and change. Dweck argues that a growth mindset is more beneficial for success than a fixed mindset.

She cites research that shows that people with a growth mindset are more likely to achieve their goals, even in the face of setbacks. She also discusses some of the ways to develop a growth mindset, such as challenging yourself, learning from your mistakes, and believing in yourself.

The video "Growth Mindset Introduction" is a helpful and informative introduction to the concept of mindset. It provides a clear explanation of the two types of mindsets and why a growth mindset is more beneficial for success. The video also provides some practical tips on how to develop a growth mindset.

If you're interested in learning more about mindset and how to develop a growth mindset, I highly recommend watching this video.

**key takeaways from the video:**

* **Mindset is important.** The way you think about your intelligence and abilities can have a big impact on your success.
* **There are two types of mindsets.** Fixed mindset: believe that intelligence and abilities are fixed. Growth mindset: believe that intelligence and abilities can grow and change.
* **A growth mindset is beneficial for success.** People with a growth mindset are more likely to achieve their goals, even in the face of setbacks.
* **Mindset can be changed.** It's not easy, but it's possible to develop a growth mindset if you're willing to work at it.

## 4. What are your key takeaways from the video to take action on? 

My key takeaways from the video "Growth Mindset Introduction" to take action on:

* **Challenge yourself.** Set challenging goals for yourself and don't be afraid to fail. When you fail, don't see it as a sign that you're not smart enough. See it as an opportunity to learn and grow.
* **Learn from your mistakes.** When you make a mistake, don't dwell on it. Instead, analyze what went wrong and figure out how you can do better next time.
* **Believe in yourself.** Believe that you can improve your intelligence and abilities through hard work and effort. Even if you don't feel smart right now, keep believing in yourself and keep working hard.

The actions that you can take to develop a growth mindset:

* **Pay attention to your own thoughts and beliefs about your intelligence.** Are you more likely to think in terms of fixed mindset statements like "I'm just not a math person" or "I'm not creative"? Or do you tend to think in terms of growth mindset statements like "I'm not good at math yet, but I can get better" or "I'm not sure how to be creative, but I'm willing to experiment and learn"?
* **Challenge the negative thoughts that come up when you're faced with a challenge.** If you start to think "I'm not smart enough to do this," remind yourself that intelligence is not fixed and that you can improve your abilities through hard work and effort.
* **Find role models who have a growth mindset.** Pay attention to the people in your life who seem to be constantly learning and growing. What are their attitudes about intelligence and ability? What can you learn from them?

## 5. What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?

The internal locus of control is the belief that one's own actions and decisions are the primary determinants of one's successes and failures. People with an internal locus of control believe that they are in control of their own destiny, and that they can achieve their goals through hard work and effort.

The key point of the video is that having an internal locus of control is essential for staying motivated. When we believe that we are in control of our own destiny, we are more likely to persist in the face of challenges and setbacks. We are also more likely to take risks and try new things.

The video cites a study in which two groups of students were given a series of puzzles to solve. The first group was told that they did well because they were smart, while the second group was told that they did well because they worked hard. The students in the first group spent less time on the harder puzzles and were less motivated to solve them, while the students in the second group spent more time on the harder puzzles and were more motivated to solve them.

This study suggests that people with an internal locus of control are more likely to be challenged by difficult tasks, while people with an external locus of control are more likely to give up easily.

The video concludes by providing some tips for adopting an internal locus of control. These tips include:

* Focus on your own strengths and abilities.
* Set challenging goals for yourself and believe that you can achieve them.
* Take responsibility for your own actions and choices.
* Don't give up easily.
* Learn from your mistakes and setbacks.
* Celebrate your successes.

If you can adopt an internal locus of control, you will be more likely to stay motivated and achieve your goals.

## 6. Paraphrase the video in a few lines in your own words.

The summary of the video in my own words:

Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence and abilities can be developed through hard work and effort. People with a growth mindset believe that they can learn new things and improve their skills, even if they are not naturally talented. They are not afraid to challenge themselves, and they view mistakes as opportunities to learn.

Fixed mindset, on the other hand, is the belief that intelligence and abilities are fixed. People with a fixed mindset believe that they are born with a certain level of intelligence and ability, and that they cannot change it. They are afraid to challenge themselves, and they view mistakes as signs of failure.

Research has shown that people with a growth mindset are more likely to succeed in school, at work, and in life. They are also more likely to be resilient in the face of challenges. If you want to be successful, it is important to develop a growth mindset.

Here are some tips for developing a growth mindset:

* Embrace challenges.

## 8. What are one or more points that you want to take action on from the manual? 

I want to take action on:

1. **I will not give up on problems.** I tend to get frustrated easily when I'm stuck on a problem, but I know that the more I struggle, the better I'll understand the material. So I'm going to make a conscious effort to stay calm and focused when I'm faced with a challenge.
2. **I will treat new concepts and situations as learning opportunities.** I'm often intimidated by new things, but I know that's just my fear of the unknown talking. So I'm going to make a point of stepping outside of my comfort zone and embracing new challenges.
3. **I will be friends with confusion, discomfort, and errors.** These are all signs that I'm learning and growing. So I'm going to welcome them with open arms and use them to my advantage.

I think these three points will help me become a better software developer. I'm excited to put them into practice and see how they help me grow.

Here are some specific actions I can take to implement these points:

* **When I'm stuck on a problem, I'll take a break and come back to it later.** This will help me clear my head and come at the problem with fresh eyes.
* **I'll find a mentor or study group to help me learn new concepts.** This will give me someone to bounce ideas off of and help me stay motivated.
* **I'll keep a journal of my learning experiences.** This will help me track my progress and identify areas where I need to improve.

I believe that by taking action on these points, I can become a better software developer. I'm excited to see how my journey unfolds.
